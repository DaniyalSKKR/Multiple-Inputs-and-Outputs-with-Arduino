Brief Description of Function:

The system consists of four LEDs, a joystick, a photoresistor, and a piezo sounder. The LEDs will illuminate based on the direction indicated by the joystick. Additionally, music will play via sounder, and its tempo will be determined by the amount of light detected by the photoresistor.
